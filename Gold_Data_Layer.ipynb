Players who do not play more than 2 complete seasons would likely be unhelpful.  Additionally, players who have appeared in the NHL in fewer than 3 (also adjustable by the user) seasons will be excluded.  Stints shorter than 10 games will be excluded as well, as these are small sample sizes and the players performance during that brief period could be high or low due to normal variance.\n",
