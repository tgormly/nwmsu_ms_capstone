That said, we found that the teammate variables can be beneficial to predicting a player's performance score. When these variables were removed, model performance decreased. In the initial model run, the R² of 0.128 is not particularly impressive, but it is markedly higher than the R² score when only age, year, and percent_through_career were considered."
