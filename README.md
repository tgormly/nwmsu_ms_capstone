<strong>Summary</strong>
It has been anecdotally mentioned that players have performed better after trades and other roster updates resulted in them having more fellow countrymen on their team, particularly when the players are not from the United States and Canada.  This project will explore that notion by comparing player performance over their career with the percentage of fellow countrymen on their team.  This will be compared to other metrics to determine how strong of a correlation there is.
