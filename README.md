<strong>Summary</strong>
It has been anecdotally mentioned that players have performed better after trades and other roster updates resulted in them having more fellow countrymen on their team, particularly when the players are not from the United States and Canada.  This project will explore that notion by comparing player performance over their career with the percentage of fellow countrymen on their team.  This will be compared to other metrics to determine how strong of a correlation there is.

Data comes from this dataset, originally from 

The steps in your project implementation (optional: include a diagram).
The key components of your approach and the results you generate.
The limitations of the project (what is specifically not covered).
Easy to find, clickable link to your public Overleaf.
Easy to find, clickable link to your public GitHub project repository.
Outline with other main sections of your project - from your outline and  project-specific sections/subsections.
At least 2 full citations in your initial draft. Find some articles, papers, or websites you will use. Demonstrate your ability to cite references by having at least 2-3 citations in your initial draft.
Comment out unnecessary content from the template, but keep it available - you'll likely reuse example code for Figures and Tables.
Verify uniqueness and overall appearance. Low, single-digit uniqueness scores earn maximum credit. Similarity scores are often higher at the beginning as we use standard sections and popular citations in the papers. Similarity scores decrease as you develop your own unique contribution to our collective body of knowledge.
